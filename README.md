## 🔎 What do you get

In this recipe, we offer an implementation of a medical visit booking, where the doctor sets up his available slots during each day, and patients can find and pay for any upcoming available appointments.

Main features:

- Fully hosted or self-hosted configuration environment. You choose the option that fits for you.

- Centralized and configurable functions to generate the bookable items

- Search and input forms for the administrator (doctor) to activate the available time slots during each day.

- Fully automated payment service (Stripe) integration to generate payment links for the users (patients)

- Search and input forms for the users (patients) to look for the upcoming available slots and book/pay for them.

- Automated appointment reminders for both the admin and the users, which can be directly imported to the phones' calendar.

- Fully open-sourced solution. You can use it as it is, tweak or extend it as much as you like. Everything under your control!
